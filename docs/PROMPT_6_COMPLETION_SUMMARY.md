```

### 2. Entry Point Scripts

**launch-desktop.cmd** - Launches GGs Desktop
- Cyan-colored neon ASCII intro
- Calls LaunchControl with desktop profile
- Sets working directory to GGs root
- Clear error messages for missing files

**launch-errorlogviewer.cmd** - Launches ErrorLogViewer
- Yellow-colored neon ASCII intro
- Calls LaunchControl with errorlogviewer profile

**launch-fusion.cmd** - Launches both Desktop + ErrorLogViewer
- Green-colored neon ASCII intro
- Calls LaunchControl with fusion profile

### 3. Core Features

#### Privilege Detection
- Uses WindowsIdentity/WindowsPrincipal for elevation detection
- Displays clear status: "Running with standard user privileges (non-admin mode)"
- Supports --elevate flag for explicit elevation requests
- Treats Win32 error 1223 (UAC cancelled) as expected success

#### Health Checks
- **DotNetRuntime:** Validates .NET 9.0 is installed
- **FileExists:** Checks for required executables
- **DirectoryExists:** Validates directories (with auto-fix)
- **DiskSpace:** Ensures minimum free space (1 GB)
- **PortAvailable:** Checks TCP port availability
- **GpuFeatures:** Validates GPU (simplified)

#### Application Launching
- Resolves paths relative to working directory
- Supports elevation via "runas" verb
- Handles Win32Exception 1223 gracefully
- Provides clear error messages
- Supports FireAndForget, WaitForAll, WaitForAny exit policies

#### Structured Logging
- JSON logs to launcher-logs/ directory
- Filename format: `{profile}-{timestamp}-{mode}.log`
- Includes correlation IDs, timestamps, status codes

#### Rich Terminal UI
- Neon ASCII art intro using Spectre.Console FigletText
- Status tables with property/value pairs
- Health check results in formatted tables
- Color-coded status indicators (✓ PASS, ✗ FAIL, ? INFO)

### 4. Profile Configuration

Profiles are declarative JSON files with:
- **applications:** List of apps to launch with paths, arguments, elevation requirements
- **healthChecks:** Preflight validation checks
- **exitPolicy:** FireAndForget, WaitForAll, or WaitForAny
- **requiresElevation:** Whether profile needs admin rights
- **startupDelayMs:** Delay between launching multiple apps

Example (desktop.json):
```json
{
  "name": "desktop",
  "description": "Launch GGs Desktop application with full UI",
  "applications": [
    {
      "name": "GGs Desktop",
      "executablePath": "clients/GGs.Desktop/bin/Release/net9.0-windows/GGs.Desktop.exe",
      "requiresElevation": false,
      "optional": false
    }
  ],
  "healthChecks": [
    {
      "type": "DotNetRuntime",
      "target": ".NET 9.0",
      "required": true
    },
    {
      "type": "FileExists",
      "target": "clients/GGs.Desktop/bin/Release/net9.0-windows/GGs.Desktop.exe",
      "required": true
    }
  ],
  "exitPolicy": "FireAndForget"
}
```

## Root Cause Fixes Applied

### Issue 1: IL2026 Trimming Warning
**Root Cause:** JsonSerializer.Deserialize<T> incompatible with trimming  
**Fix:** Created LaunchProfileJsonContext with [JsonSerializable] attributes  
**Result:** Zero warnings

### Issue 2: CA1416 Platform Compatibility
**Root Cause:** WindowsIdentity/WindowsPrincipal used in cross-platform TFM  
**Fix:** Changed TargetFramework from net9.0 to net9.0-windows  
**Result:** Zero warnings

### Issue 3: Markup Parsing Error
**Root Cause:** Spectre.Console tried to parse `<name>` and `<mode>` as style tags  
**Fix:** Changed to `[[options]]` and `[grey]NAME[/]` markup  
**Result:** Help display works correctly

### Issue 4: Path Resolution
**Root Cause:** Paths resolved relative to LaunchControl.exe location (publish folder)  
**Fix:** Changed to resolve relative to current working directory  
**Result:** Applications launch successfully
