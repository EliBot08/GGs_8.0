## Root Cause Fixes Applied

1. **IL2026 Trimming Warning**
   - Root Cause: JsonSerializer.Deserialize<T> incompatible with trimming
   - Fix: Created LaunchProfileJsonContext with JSON source generation
   - Result: Zero warnings

2. **CA1416 Platform Compatibility**
   - Root Cause: WindowsIdentity/WindowsPrincipal used in cross-platform TFM
   - Fix: Changed TargetFramework to net9.0-windows
   - Result: Zero warnings

3. **Markup Parsing Error**
   - Root Cause: Spectre.Console tried to parse `<name>` as style tags
   - Fix: Changed to `[[options]]` and `[grey]NAME[/]` markup
   - Result: Help display works correctly

4. **Path Resolution**
   - Root Cause: Paths resolved relative to LaunchControl.exe location
   - Fix: Changed to resolve relative to current working directory
   - Result: All profiles launch successfully
