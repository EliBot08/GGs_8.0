3. ✅ **FAIL FAST WITH PRECISION** - Clear error messages with remediation steps
4. ✅ **SECURITY BY DEFAULT** - Code analysis, nullable types, deterministic builds
5. ✅ **STRONG CONTRACTS & TYPES** - Nullable reference types enabled
6. ✅ **OBSERVABILITY FIRST** - Comprehensive logging, OpenTelemetry, health endpoints
7. ✅ **PERFORMANCE & EFFICIENCY** - ReadyToRun, tiered compilation, parallel builds
8. ✅ **TEST PYRAMID EXCELLENCE** - 100% test pass rate, smoke tests
9. ✅ **CONTINUOUS DELIVERY** - CI/CD pipeline with 4 jobs
10. ✅ **AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION** - Self-healing patterns documented
