GGs Premium Experience Playbook
================================

## Pillar A – Unified Visual Language & Depth
- **A1. Design token refactor (`clients/GGs.Desktop/Themes/`)**
  - Replace ad-hoc resource dictionaries with a `ThemeTokens.xaml` defining spacing scale, radius scale, elevation shadows, gradient ramps, and dynamic accent palette slots (Primary, Secondary, Success, Critical, FrostedOverlay).
  - Introduce typography tokens (Display, Title, Body, MicroCopy) tuned to `Segoe UI Variable` optical sizes with precise letter-spacing for light/dark modes. Update `App.xaml` merges accordingly.
  - Normalize blur, frosted glass, and neon edge treatments by creating reusable `Style`/`ControlTemplate` assets for cards, modals, quick action chips, and nav items.
- **A2. Spatial hierarchy polishing (`clients/GGs.Desktop/Views/ModernMainWindow.xaml`)**
  - Re-grid the shell using a 12-column layout that scales between 1200–1920px, ensuring side navigation locks to 240px and content uses responsive gutters.
  - Add layered backgrounds with parallax-ready `Grid` zones (e.g., a subtle gradient wash in the content root, elevated cards with `DropShadowEffect` and `OpacityMask`).
  - Audit every `Margin`/`Padding` to align with the spacing scale (4/8/12/16/24). Replace magic numbers in `DashboardView.xaml`, `OptimizationView.xaml`, and `ErrorLogViewer.xaml`.

## Pillar B – Motion System & Micro-Interactions
- **B1. Navigation choreography (`ModernMainWindow.xaml.cs`)**
  - Replace manual `Visibility` toggles with a `TransitioningContentControl` (WPF Toolkit or custom) to animate cross-fades + slight Z translate when swapping views.
  - Define storyboard resources for nav selection (color morph, icon bounce, background sweep). Trigger on `Checked` via `EventSetter`.
- **B2. Command surface response (`Views/ErrorLogViewer.xaml`, `Views/OptimizationView.xaml`)**
  - Add hover lift + glow micro-interactions using `ScaleTransform` + `DropShadowEffect` animations triggered on pointer over/out.
  - Implement press ripple using a short-lived `VisualBrush` ripple overlay (Composition API) for premium click feedback.
- **B3. Activation/onboarding delight (`ModernActivationWindow.xaml`)**
  - Layer in staged animations: hero illustration fade-in, input focus pulse, success confetti (particle effect via `CompositionTarget.Rendering`).
  - Extend existing fade to include blur reveal and spring easing.

## Pillar C – Data Fidelity & Live Feedback
- **C1. Replace mock telemetry (`Services/SystemMonitorService.cs`)**
  - Integrate Windows Performance Counters + WMI fallbacks into an async sampling pipeline with smoothing filters (EMA) to avoid jumpy charts.
  - Surface network throughput (Mbps up/down) and GPU memory usage to feed new chart tracks.
  - Emit `StatsUpdated` cadence at 1s; push incremental deltas to UI for real-time feel.
- **C2. Dashboard realism (`Views/DashboardView.xaml`, `DashboardView.xaml.cs`)**
  - Swap placeholder copy for data-driven `StatCard` animations (count-up, delta tickers). Use `DispatcherTimer` to animate number transitions.
  - Upgrade `PerformanceChart` to render smoothed polylines with gradient fill + glowing indicator dot, refreshed via binding to the history queue.
- **C3. Error Log insights (`Views/ErrorLogViewer.xaml`, `ViewModels/ErrorLogViewer/ErrorLogViewerViewModel.cs`)**
  - Introduce live ingestion badges, progress shimmer when filtering, and skeleton loaders for the details panel.
  - Add segmented toggle for level filters with animated underline + dynamic counts (bind to `TotalCount` per level).
  - Provide “smart summary” banner synthesizing the last 10 errors via `LogParser` heuristics.

## Pillar D – Feature Surface Elevation
- **D1. Dashboard hero zone**
  - Embed a 3D GPU showcase card (Composition surface or Lottie animation) reacting to CPU/GPU load.
  - Add contextual tips carousel with auto-transition and swipe gestures for touch (use `TransitioningContentControl`).
- **D2. Optimization workflow**
  - Convert quick action buttons into glossy `CommandChip` controls with asynchronous status (spinners, checkmarks). Wire `SystemMonitorService` to reflect immediate effect metrics.
  - Build a progress timeline modal for longer running tweaks (step badges, micro charts, confetti on completion).
- **D3. Notifications center (`Views/NotificationsView.xaml`)**
  - Replace `DataGrid` with card list using `ItemsControl` + `AdaptiveGridView` styling, featuring priority color bars, iconography, and swipe-to-mark-read interactions.
  - Add grouped headers by day/hour with sticky behavior and time-relative badges.
- **D4. EliBot chat stage (`Views/DashboardView.xaml`)**
  - Introduce typewriter animation for responses, bubble morph transitions, and ambient “breathing” idle state for the bot avatar.
  - Implement streaming responses with partial text updates and typing indicator ellipsis animation tied to signal latency.

## Pillar E – Feedback, Audio, and Delight
- **E1. Haptic-inspired sound design**
  - Curate subtle UI sounds (hover, confirm, error) with volume ducking. Expose toggles in `SettingsView` to enable/disable or choose themes.
- **E2. Ambient states**
  - Build dynamic background pulses in fullscreen overlays (e.g., scanning screens) that react to system stats.
- **E3. Achievement system**
  - Add toast banners for key milestones (first optimization, export complete) using `Snackbar`-style control with slide-in animation.

## Pillar F – Performance & Polish Assurance
- **F1. Frame diagnostics**
  - Instrument `CompositionTarget.Rendering` to log frame times and enforce <8ms render budget on key views.
  - Add `PerfframeOverlay` developer toggle to visualize layout & render passes.
- **F2. Animation QA scripts**
  - Create Playwright/WPF UI automation scripts capturing GIFs before/after to verify animation plays and no visual regressions.
- **F3. Visual regression snapshots**
  - Integrate `Verify.WPF` snapshot tests for hero cards, nav, and modal states across dark/light.

## Execution Cadence
- **Sprint 1 – Tokens & Shell**: Deliver Pillar A + B1 foundations. Output updated resource dictionaries, nav transitions, documentation of motion curves.
- **Sprint 2 – Data & Dashboards**: Complete Pillar C + D1 with live telemetry plumbing and hero zone visuals.
- **Sprint 3 – Workflows & Feedback**: Execute D2–D4, E1–E3, ensuring micro-interactions and audio cues ship together.
- **Sprint 4 – QA & Showcase**: Finalize Pillar F, generate promo-ready screen captures, and script a launch-ready product tour.

## Deliverables Checklist
- Updated design system documentation (`docs/ux/premium-style-guide.md`) with tokens, motion specs, sound palette.
- Before/after video reels (Error Log Viewer filtering, EliBot conversation, Optimization timeline) demonstrating premium transitions.
- Automated regression suite entries for animations, visuals, and telemetry bindings.
- Rollout notes for customer success highlighting premium experience upgrades.
