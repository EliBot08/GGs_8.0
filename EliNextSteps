═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
OPERATING PRINCIPLES (10X Enhanced)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🎯 PRINCIPLE 1: ROOT CAUSE ELIMINATION
   - Fix root causes, not symptoms. Eliminate placeholders, nulls, and ambiguous states
   - Every fix must include: root cause analysis, prevention strategy, and regression test
   - Document WHY decisions were made, not just WHAT was changed
   - Use static analysis and compiler features to prevent entire classes of bugs

🔄 PRINCIPLE 2: IDEMPOTENCY & RESTARTABILITY
   - Prefer idempotent, restartable operations. Every step can be rerun safely
   - All operations must be atomic or compensatable with clear rollback paths
   - State transitions must be explicit, logged, and recoverable
   - Use transactional boundaries and saga patterns for distributed operations

⚡ PRINCIPLE 3: FAIL FAST WITH PRECISION
   - Fail fast with precise diagnostics; never fail silently
   - Every error must include: context, correlation ID, remediation steps, and next actions
   - Structured logging with stable schemas; PII-safe redaction by default
   - Error budgets and SLOs tracked; alerts with actionable runbooks

🔒 PRINCIPLE 4: SECURITY BY DEFAULT
   - Default secure: secrets from vault, no plaintext creds, signed outputs only
   - Least privilege everywhere; defense in depth; assume breach mentality
   - Input validation at all boundaries; output encoding; CSRF/XSS protection
   - Regular security audits; dependency scanning; SBOM generation

🏗️ PRINCIPLE 5: STRONG CONTRACTS & TYPES
   - Strong typing at domain boundaries; nullable reference types enabled
   - API contracts versioned and backward compatible; breaking changes gated
   - Schema validation for all external data; fail on unknown properties
   - Use discriminated unions and result types instead of exceptions for expected failures

📊 PRINCIPLE 6: OBSERVABILITY FIRST
   - Instrument before implementing; telemetry is not optional
   - Distributed tracing with correlation IDs propagated across all boundaries
   - Metrics with dimensions; logs with structure; traces with context
   - Health probes (liveness, readiness, startup) with self-healing capabilities

⚙️ PRINCIPLE 7: PERFORMANCE & EFFICIENCY
   - Async I/O everywhere; pooled buffers; zero-allocation hot paths
   - Cache with TTL + stampede protection; lazy initialization with thread safety
   - Benchmark-driven optimization; profile before optimizing
   - Resource limits and backpressure; graceful degradation under load

🧪 PRINCIPLE 8: TEST PYRAMID EXCELLENCE
   - Unit tests: fast, deterministic, isolated with mocks
   - Integration tests: real I/O on ephemeral resources; hermetic by default
   - E2E tests: critical user journeys; golden screenshots for UI
   - Chaos tests: fault injection; verify recovery and alerting

🚀 PRINCIPLE 9: CONTINUOUS DELIVERY
   - Every commit is potentially shippable; trunk-based development
   - Feature flags for gradual rollout; kill switches for instant rollback
   - Blue-green deployments; canary releases; automated rollback on failure
   - Deployment metrics tracked; DORA metrics measured and improved

🤖 PRINCIPLE 10: AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION
   - Discover → Propose → Implement → Validate → Ship loop with no manual stalls
   - If blocked by environment, create stub tasks with clear prereqs and continue in parallel
   - Always write remediation steps into failure logs with next‑action hints
   - Self-healing where possible; escalate with full context when human intervention needed
